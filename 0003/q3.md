# Leetcode Question #3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Approach

1. **Brute Force Method:**

   - A brute force approach might consider generating every possible substring and checking each for uniqueness.
   - However, this results in a time complexity of O(n^3) in the worst case, which is inefficient for larger strings.

2. **Optimized Approach (Sliding Window with Hash Map):**
   - **Sliding Window Technique:**
     - Use two pointers (`start` and `end`) to represent a window within the string that contains unique characters.
     - As you move the `end` pointer, use a hash map (`seen`) to store the most recent index of each character.
     - When a character is encountered that is already in the current window (i.e., its last seen index is â‰¥ `start`), move the `start` pointer to one index after the previous occurrence of that character.
     - Continuously update the maximum length (`maxLen`) as the window expands.
   - **Machine Coding Round Discussion:**
     - Initially, a brute force solution might be proposed, but after discussing its inefficiencies, the sliding window technique is chosen.
     - This approach is explained step-by-step, starting with the brute force idea, followed by the optimization using a hash map for constant time lookups.
     - The final solution processes each character at most twice, resulting in a linear time solution.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
  Each character in the string is visited at most twice (once by the `end` pointer and possibly once by the `start` pointer).

- **Space Complexity:** O(min(n, m))  
  Where `n` is the length of the string and `m` is the size of the character set. In the worst-case scenario (all characters are unique), the space complexity is O(n).

## Sample Input/Output

- **Input:** "abcabcbb"

  - **Output:** 3
  - **Explanation:** The longest substring without repeating characters is "abc", which has a length of 3.

- **Input:** "bbbbb"
  - **Output:** 1
  - **Explanation:** The longest substring is "b" with a length of 1.

This is the most optimized solution.
