# LeetCode 148: Sort List

## Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list, return the list after sorting it in ascending order.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 10^4].
- -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5

## Approach

A brute-force approach might be to convert the linked list into an array, sort the array, and then rebuild the list. However, this approach would use extra space and is not optimal.

The optimal solution is to apply **merge sort** directly on the linked list because:

- It provides O(n log n) time complexity, which is optimal for sorting.
- It leverages sequential access of linked lists efficiently.
- It does not require random access or additional memory for storing all nodes at once.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Finding the Middle:**

   - Use the slow and fast pointer technique to locate the middle of the list.
   - This helps split the list into two halves.

2. **Recursive Sorting:**

   - Recursively sort each half of the list.
   - Base case: A list with 0 or 1 node is already sorted.

3. **Merging:**

   - Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted list using a helper function.
   - This merging is done by comparing nodes from both halves and linking the smaller one.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Ensure the solution handles empty lists and lists with a single element.

During an interview, I would explain that my initial approach would have been a brute-force method (converting the list to an array and sorting it). However, after discussing with the interviewer, I would transition to a more efficient approach using merge sort, which is better suited for linked lists due to its O(n log n) time complexity and minimal extra space usage (only O(log n) due to recursion).

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)  
  Each merge operation takes O(n) and there are log n levels of recursion.
- **Space Complexity:** O(log n)  
  The recursive calls require O(log n) space.
