# LeetCode Question 120 - Triangle

## Problem Statement

Given a triangle array, return the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.  
**Example:**

- **Input:** triangle = [[2], [3, 4], [6, 5, 7], [4, 1, 8, 3]]
- **Output:** 11
- **Explanation:** The minimum path is 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11.

## Approach

The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach.

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Array:**
   - Initialize a DP array with the values of the last row of the triangle.
2. **Iterate from Bottom to Top:**
   - Starting from the second-to-last row, update the DP array by choosing the minimum adjacent number from the row below for each element.
   - For each element `triangle[i][j]`, compute the minimum sum path from that element by:
     ```
     dp[j] = triangle[i][j] + min(dp[j], dp[j+1])
     ```
3. **Final Result:**
   - After processing all rows, the first element of the DP array (`dp[0]`) holds the minimum path sum from top to bottom.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  O(nÂ²), where n is the number of rows in the triangle. This is because we iterate over each element in the triangle.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  O(n) due to the DP array that stores the minimum path sums for the last row (which has n elements).

## Sample Input/Output

- **Sample Input:**  
  `[[2], [3, 4], [6, 5, 7], [4, 1, 8, 3]]`
- **Sample Output:**  
  `11`
