# Leetcode Question #5: Longest Palindromic Substring (Manacher's Algorithm)

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the longest palindromic substring in `s`.

## Approach

1. **Brute Force Method:**

   - Initially, one might consider checking every possible substring to determine if it is a palindrome.
   - This approach would involve O(n^3) time complexity in the worst case and is impractical for larger inputs.

2. **Expand Around Center:**

   - A better approach involves expanding around each character (and between characters) as the center of a potential palindrome.
   - Although this method improves the time complexity to O(n²) in the worst-case scenario, it still may not be efficient enough for very large strings.
   - **Concept:**  
     Every palindrome mirrors around its center. Therefore, a palindrome can have either a single center (odd-length) or two centers (even-length).
   - **Steps:**
     - Iterate through the string and consider each character as a potential center.
     - For each center, expand outward to check for the longest palindrome by comparing the characters on both sides.
     - Check both possibilities:
       - Single character center (for odd-length palindromes).
       - Two adjacent characters as a center (for even-length palindromes).
     - Update the longest palindrome found as you expand.
   - **Machine Coding Round Discussion:**
     - **Brute Force Discussion:**  
       Initially, you might mention the brute force approach, but quickly acknowledge its inefficiency due to the excessive number of substring checks.
     - **Transition to Optimized Method:**  
       Explain the idea of expanding around a center, which significantly reduces unnecessary computations by stopping the expansion when a mismatch occurs.
     - **Final Optimized Solution:**  
       The final solution leverages the expand-around-center approach to achieve a balance between clarity and efficiency, with a time complexity of O(n²) and constant space usage.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n²)  
  In the worst-case scenario, each center expansion could traverse the entire string.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
  Only a fixed amount of extra space is used regardless of the input size.

3. **Optimized Approach with Manacher's Algorithm:**
   - **Concept:**  
     Manacher's algorithm transforms the input string by inserting a special character (e.g., `#`) between every two characters, as well as at the beginning and end (with additional boundary markers like `^` and `$`).  
     This transformation allows us to handle even- and odd-length palindromes uniformly.
   - **Steps:**
     - **Transform the String:**  
       For example, for `s = "abc"`, the transformed string `T` becomes `^#a#b#c#$`.
     - **Initialize Variables:**  
       Create an array `P` to store the palindrome radius for each character in `T`, and initialize center (`C`) and right boundary (`R`) pointers.
     - **Iterate and Expand:**  
       For each character in the transformed string, calculate its mirror with respect to the current center.  
       If the current index is within the right boundary, set the initial radius as the minimum of `R - i` and `P[mirror]`.  
       Then, expand around the current center until the characters no longer match.
     - **Update Center and Right Boundary:**  
       If the palindrome expands past `R`, update the center `C` and right boundary `R` accordingly.
     - **Extract the Longest Palindrome:**  
       Finally, find the maximum radius in `P` and compute the starting index in the original string to extract the longest palindromic substring.
   - **Machine Coding Round Discussion:**  
     In an interview, one would start by discussing the brute force method and its inefficiencies, move on to the expand-around-center approach, and finally explain Manacher's algorithm as a linear time solution that cleverly uses string transformation and symmetry properties.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
  The algorithm processes each character in the transformed string in linear time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)  
  Extra space is used for the transformed string and the auxiliary array `P`.

## Sample Input/Output

- **Input:** "babad"
  - **Output:** "bab" or "aba"
- **Input:** "cbbd"
  - **Output:** "bb"

This is the most optimized solution using Manacher's algorithm.
