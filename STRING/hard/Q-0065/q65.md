# Leetcode Question #65: Valid Number

## Problem Statement

Determine if a given string `s` is a valid number. A valid number can include:

- Optional leading and trailing whitespaces.
- An optional sign (`+` or `-`).
- A sequence of digits, which can have an optional decimal point.
- An optional exponent part, which consists of an `e` or `E`, an optional sign, and one or more digits.
  Examples of valid numbers include: "0", " 0.1 ", "2e10", " -90e3 ", and "53.5e93".

## Approach

1. **Initial Thoughts and Brute Force Idea:**

   - One may consider writing a state machine (finite automata) to manually parse the string character by character.
   - This approach would involve enumerating all possible valid states (e.g., integer part, decimal part, exponent part) and transitions between them.
   - While itâ€™s a systematic approach, it can become verbose and error-prone when dealing with all edge cases.

2. **Optimized Approach Using Regular Expression:**
   - **Concept:**  
     A regular expression (regex) can concisely capture the format of a valid number.
   - **Regex Breakdown:**
     - `^\s*` and `\s*$` allow for optional leading and trailing whitespaces.
     - `[+-]?` permits an optional sign at the start.
     - The core numeric part is handled by `((\d+(\.\d*)?)|(\.\d+))` which:
       - Matches numbers with digits before an optional decimal point.
       - Also handles cases where the number starts with a decimal point but is followed by digits.
     - `([eE][+-]?\d+)?` is an optional group that matches the exponent part.
   - **Machine Coding Round Discussion:**
     - **Brute Force Discussion:**  
       Initially, one might propose a manual parser to handle each part of the number. However, after discussing its complexity, the regex solution is preferred for its succinctness and clarity.
     - **Transition to Regex:**  
       The regex approach not only reduces code complexity but also efficiently validates the string in a single pass over the input.
     - **Final Decision:**  
       In an interview setting, after outlining the manual parsing method, I would advocate for the regex solution due to its clarity and ease of implementation while still providing O(n) time complexity.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - The regex evaluation checks the string in linear time relative to its length.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - The regex and function use a constant amount of additional space regardless of the input size.

## Sample Input/Output

- **Input:** "0"
  - **Output:** true
- **Input:** " 0.1 "
  - **Output:** true
- **Input:** "abc"
  - **Output:** false
- **Input:** "2e10"
  - **Output:** true
- **Input:** " 99e2.5 "
  - **Output:** false

This solution is the most optimized approach for this problem, balancing clarity with efficiency.
