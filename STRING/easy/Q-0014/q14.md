# Leetcode Question #14: Longest Common Prefix

## Problem Statement

Given an array of strings, write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst them. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

## Approach

1. **Brute Force Method:**

   - One might consider comparing each string with every other string to determine the common prefix. However, this approach is inefficient and can lead to unnecessary repeated comparisons.

2. **Optimized Approach (Vertical Scanning):**
   - **Step-by-Step:**
     - Use the first string as the reference for the prefix.
     - Iterate over the characters of the first string.
     - For each character, compare it with the corresponding character in all other strings.
     - If a mismatch is found or any string reaches its end, stop the process and return the substring from the first string up to the current index.
     - If all characters match for the full length of the first string, then the first string is the common prefix.
   - **Machine Coding Round Discussion:**
     - Initially, a brute force approach may be suggested, but upon realizing the inefficiency with multiple comparisons, a vertical scanning strategy is preferred.
     - In an interview scenario, I would explain that by iterating character by character and comparing across all strings, the solution can stop early once a mismatch is encountered, making it more efficient.
     - This results in a clean and optimal solution that handles both the best and worst-case scenarios effectively.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(S), where S is the sum of all characters in all strings. In the worst case, every character of every string is compared.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) since no extra space is used aside from variables for iteration.

## Sample Input/Output

- **Input:** ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
  - **Output:** "fl"
  - **Explanation:** The characters 'f' and 'l' are common in all strings at the beginning.
- **Input:** ["dog", "racecar", "car"]
  - **Output:** ""
  - **Explanation:** There is no common starting character among the strings.

This is the most optimized solution for this problem.
