# LeetCode 912: Sort an Array

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

## Approach

### Initial Consideration (Brute Force)

A straightforward approach might involve using JavaScript's built-in sort function with a custom comparator (i.e., `nums.sort((a, b) => a - b)`). However, while this method is concise, it doesn't demonstrate a deeper understanding of sorting algorithms or their performance characteristics.

### Optimized Approach (Merge Sort)

A more robust solution is to implement the merge sort algorithm:

1. **Divide:** Recursively split the array into two halves until each subarray contains only one element.
2. **Conquer:** Each subarray is trivially sorted.
3. **Combine:** Merge the sorted subarrays by comparing elements from each half and constructing a sorted result array.

**Interview Discussion:**
During an interview, I would explain that my initial idea was to use the built-in sort due to its simplicity. However, I then shifted focus to merge sort as it guarantees O(n log n) time complexity regardless of the input distribution. I would further detail the recursive breakdown of the array, followed by the merging process, which effectively combines sorted subarrays. This method not only demonstrates algorithmic understanding but also addresses space-time trade-offs.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
  - The array is recursively divided into halves (log n levels) and merging at each level takes O(n) time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - Additional space is used during the merging process to store temporary arrays.
