# Leetcode Question #10: Regular Expression Matching

## Problem Statement

Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'` where:

- `'.'` matches any single character.
- `'*'` matches zero or more of the preceding element.
  The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

## Approach

1. **Brute Force Idea:**

   - One might start with a recursive approach that tries to match the string with the pattern character by character.
   - However, this recursive method leads to exponential time complexity due to overlapping subproblems.

2. **Optimized Approach Using Dynamic Programming:**
   - **Concept:**  
     Create a 2D DP table `dp[i][j]` where each cell represents whether `s[0..i-1]` matches `p[0..j-1]`.
   - **Initialization:**
     - `dp[0][0]` is `true` because an empty pattern matches an empty string.
     - For patterns that can match an empty string (like "a*", "a*b\*", etc.), initialize `dp[0][j]` accordingly.
   - **DP Transition:**
     - **Direct Match or Wildcard (`.`):**  
       If `p[j-1]` equals `s[i-1]` or `p[j-1]` is a `'.'`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.
     - **Handling `'*'`:**  
       There are two cases to consider:
       1. **Zero Occurrences:**  
          Treat the `*` as representing zero occurrences of the preceding element. Hence, `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-2]`.
       2. **One or More Occurrences:**  
          If the preceding element of `'*'` matches `s[i-1]` (or is `'.'`), then extend the matching by setting  
          `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] || dp[i-1][j]`.
   - **Machine Coding Round Discussion:**  
     In an interview, I would first discuss the recursive solution and explain its exponential blowup. Then, Iâ€™d propose memoization to reduce redundant calculations, finally converging on a bottom-up dynamic programming approach that guarantees O(m \* n) time complexity.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(m \* n)  
  where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `p`.  
  Each state in the DP table is computed once.

- **Space Complexity:** O(m \* n)  
  The DP table requires additional space proportional to the product of the lengths of `s` and `p`.

## Sample Input/Output

- **Input:** s = "aa", p = "a"  
  **Output:** false

- **Input:** s = "aa", p = "a\*"  
  **Output:** true

- **Input:** s = "ab", p = ".\*"  
  **Output:** true

---

This is the most optimized solution.
