# LeetCode Problem 4: Median of Two Sorted Arrays

## Problem Statement

Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of sizes `m` and `n` respectively, find the median of the two sorted arrays. The final solution should aim for a runtime complexity of O(log (m+n)).

## Initial Approach (Brute Force)

1. **Merge and Sort:**

   - **Idea:** Combine both arrays into one and then sort the resulting array.
   - **Finding the Median:** Once sorted, the median can be found by picking the middle element (or the average of the two middle elements if the total count is even).
   - **Drawback:**
     - The merge and sort operation results in a time complexity of O((m+n) log(m+n)), which is not efficient for large input sizes.

2. **Optimized Merge using Two-Pointers:**
   - **Idea:** Since both arrays are already sorted, use a two-pointer approach (similar to the merge step in merge sort) to merge the arrays in linear time.
   - **Finding the Median:** Once merged, traverse the merged array to find the median.
   - **Drawback:**
     - Even though this approach has an improved time complexity of O(m+n), it still does not meet the required O(log (m+n)) target.

## Optimized Approach

To achieve the desired logarithmic complexity, the following approach is used:

1. **Binary Search on the Smaller Array:**

   - Let `x = nums1.length` and `y = nums2.length`, ensuring that `x <= y`.
   - Initialize two pointers for binary search on `nums1`:
     - `low = 0`
     - `high = x`

2. **Partitioning Strategy with Variables:**

   - Compute `partitionX` in `nums1` as:
     - `partitionX = Math.floor((low + high) / 2)`
   - Determine the corresponding partition index `partitionY` in `nums2` as:
     - `partitionY = Math.floor((x + y + 1) / 2) - partitionX`
   - Define the edge variables for partitioning:
     - `maxLeftX`: The greatest element on the left side of `nums1` (if `partitionX` is 0, then `maxLeftX = -Infinity`).
     - `minRightX`: The smallest element on the right side of `nums1` (if `partitionX` equals `x`, then `minRightX = Infinity`).
     - `maxLeftY`: The greatest element on the left side of `nums2` (if `partitionY` is 0, then `maxLeftY = -Infinity`).
     - `minRightY`: The smallest element on the right side of `nums2` (if `partitionY` equals `y`, then `minRightY = Infinity`).

3. **Validity Check and Adjustments:**

   - The partition is correct if both conditions hold:
     - `maxLeftX <= minRightY`
     - `maxLeftY <= minRightX`
   - If the condition fails because `maxLeftX > minRightY`, move the binary search left by setting:
     - `high = partitionX - 1`
   - Otherwise, if `maxLeftY > minRightX`, move right by setting:
     - `low = partitionX + 1`
   - Continue adjusting until the correct partition is found.

4. **Median Calculation:**
   - Once the correct partition is found:
     - If the total number of elements `(x + y)` is even, the median is calculated as:
       ```
       (Math.max(maxLeftX, maxLeftY) + Math.min(minRightX, minRightY)) / 2
       ```
     - If the total number of elements is odd, the median is:
       ```
       Math.max(maxLeftX, maxLeftY)
       ```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Brute Force (Merge and Sort):**

  - _Time Complexity:_ O((m+n) log(m+n))
  - _Space Complexity:_ O(m+n)

- **Two-Pointer Merge:**

  - _Time Complexity:_ O(m+n)
  - _Space Complexity:_ O(m+n)

- **Optimized Binary Search Partition:**
  - _Time Complexity:_ O(log(min(m, n)))  
    (Binary search is applied on the smaller array, ensuring logarithmic performance.)
  - _Space Complexity:_ O(1)

## Sample Input and Output

- **Input:**
  - `nums1 = [1, 3]`
  - `nums2 = [2]`
- **Output:**
  - `2.0`
