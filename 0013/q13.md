# Leetcode Question #13: Roman to Integer

## Problem Statement

Convert a given Roman numeral string into its corresponding integer. Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M. For example, "MCMXCIV" represents 1994.

## Approach

1. **Brute Force Idea:**

   - Initially, one might consider checking every possible combination of symbols to compute the value.
   - However, due to the subtractive notation used in Roman numerals (e.g., IV for 4), this method can become complicated and inefficient.

2. **Optimized Approach:**

   - Use a hash map (or dictionary) to store the integer values for each Roman numeral symbol.
   - Traverse the string from left to right.
   - For each character, compare its value to the next characterâ€™s value:
     - **Subtraction:** If the current symbol's value is less than the next one, subtract its value.
     - **Addition:** Otherwise, add its value.
   - This method ensures each character is processed only once, achieving an optimal solution.

3. **Machine Coding Round Explanation:**
   - **Step 1: Brute Force Discussion**  
     Initially, you might suggest checking each substring, but quickly recognize that handling the subtractive cases in a brute force method would lead to an overly complex solution with poor performance.
   - **Step 2: Moving to the Sliding Comparison**  
     Then, you would propose using a hash map to store the numeral values and iterate through the string. By comparing each numeral with its successor, you can decide whether to add or subtract the value, leading to a linear time solution.
   - **Step 3: Final Optimized Version**  
     The final implementation uses a single pass through the string with O(n) time complexity and constant space for the map, which is both efficient and straightforward.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the Roman numeral string, as we traverse it only once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since the hash map contains a fixed number of entries (7 symbols), regardless of the input size.

## Sample Input/Output

- **Input:** "MCMXCIV"
- **Output:** 1994
- **Explanation:**  
  The numeral is processed as follows:
  - M (1000) is added.
  - C (100) is subtracted because it comes before M (1000).
  - M (1000) is added.
  - X (10) is subtracted because it comes before C (100).
  - C (100) is added.
  - I (1) is subtracted because it comes before V (5).
  - V (5) is added.
    The resulting total is 1994.

This is the most optimized solution.
