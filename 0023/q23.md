# LeetCode 23: Merge k Sorted Lists

## Problem Statement

Given an array of k linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order. Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

## Approach

### Brute Force (Initial Thought Process)

One might initially consider merging all the lists by:

- Extracting all values into a single array.
- Sorting the array.
- Rebuilding the linked list from the sorted array.

While this method is straightforward, it requires O(N) extra space and doesn't leverage the fact that the input lists are already sorted.

### Optimized Approach (Divide and Conquer)

A more optimal solution leverages the sorted nature of the lists by:

1. **Pairwise Merging:**
   - Merge two lists at a time using a helper function `mergeTwoLists`.
   - Repeatedly merge the lists in pairs, reducing the total number of lists by half on each iteration.
2. **Divide and Conquer:**
   - This approach works similarly to merge sort, where the merging process guarantees that the time complexity remains optimal.

**Interview Discussion:**  
In a coding interview, I would start by explaining the brute force approach and its limitations regarding space. I would then move to the divide and conquer method, detailing how merging pairs of lists repeatedly ensures an efficient solution. This method minimizes extra space usage (only requiring O(1) extra space for merging two lists at a time, aside from recursion overhead) and achieves a time complexity of O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes and k is the number of lists.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(N log k)  
  Merging two lists takes O(N) in total across all levels of merging, and there are log k merging rounds.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (ignoring recursion stack)  
  The in-place merging of two lists uses constant extra space, though recursion adds O(log k) space.
